## What is a game?

I know people do know what is a game but basically, a game is a structured activity or form of entertainment in which players engage in a specific set of rules and objectives. It usually involves one or more participants who interact with each other or with a defined system to achieve a particular goal. Games can take various forms, including physical activities, board games, card games, video games, and sports.

Games typically have specific rules that govern the behavior and interactions of the participants. These rules may define the objectives of the game, the boundaries within which it is played, the resources or tools available to the players, and the actions they can take. The rules often create a competitive or cooperative environment, providing challenges and obstacles that players must overcome to succeed.

- Activities or actions refer to the specific tasks, movements, or behaviors that participants engage in during the game. The activities or actions in a game are often designed to challenge and engage the plays, requiring their involvement and interaction with the game system
  or other players.
- Rules and boundaries establish the framework and limitations within which the game operates. They define what is allowed and what is not allowed within the game's context. Rules can cover various aspects of the game, including player behavior, movement, use of resources,
   scoring, and winning conditions. Boundaries set the limits of the game, such as physical boundaries in a sports game or the constraints of the game world in a video game. The rules and boundaries provide structure and fairness to the game, ensuring that all participants
   understand how to play and compete.
- Objectives or aims define the goals that players strive to achieve within the game. They give purpose and direction to the gameplay, providing a target or outcome that players aim to reach. Objectives can be diverse and depend on the type of game. For example, in a
  competitive game, the objective may be to outscore or defeat opponents, while in a cooperative game, the objective may be to work together to solve a problem or complete a task. Objectives provide motivation and a sense of progression as players work towards accomplishing
   them.
- Participants or players are the individuals who engage in the game. They actively take part in the activities, follow the rules, pursue the objectives, and interact with other participants or the game system. The number of participants can vary depending on the game,
  ranging from solitary games that can be played alone to multiplayer games involving multiple individuals or teams. Players contribute to the dynamics of the game through their decisions, actions, strategies, and interactions, shaping the overall experience and outcomes.

These elements collectively define the fundamental components of a game, providing structure, purpose, and engagement for the participants. They create an interactive and rule-based system where players can immerse themselves, compete, collaborate, and derive enjoyment
or satisfaction from their involvement.
## Twister
- Twister is played on a large plastic mat that is spread on the floor or ground. The mat has four rows of six large colored circles on it with a different color in each row: red, yellow, green and blue. A spinner tells players where they have to place their hand or foot.
  The game promotes itself as "the game that ties you up in knots".
- A spinner is attached to a square board and is used to determine where the player has to put their hand or foot. The spinner is divided into four labeled sections: left foot, right foot, left hand, and right hand. Each of those four sections are divided into the four colors (red, yellow, green, and blue). After spinning, the combination is called (for example: "right hand yellow") and players must move their matching hand or foot to a circle of the correct color. In a two-player game, no two people can have a hand or foot on the same circle; the rules are different for more players. Owing to the scarcity of colored circles, players will often be required to put themselves in unlikely or precarious positions, eventually causing someone to fall. A person is eliminated when they fall or when their elbow or knee touches the mat.
## The NINJA game
[How to play](https://frugalfun4boys.com/how-to-play-the-game-ninja/)

__Here’s how to play:__

- All the players stand with their hands together, facing the center of the circle.
- Everyone says, “3, 2, 1, NINJA!” and then freezes in a cool ninja pose. (This is the favorite part!)
- Each player takes a turn doing a ninja move. Turns move around the circle, just like any other game.
- The object of the game is to get the other players “out,” one limb at a time.
- When it’s your turn, you get one move. You can karate chop another player’s arm below the elbow, or kick their ankle or foot. You can try to get any player out – it does not need to be the person next to you. You can take a step as part of your move, but only one step. For example, you can step forward or backwards and do a karate chop with your arm. The player being attacked can dodge your ninja move. If you successfully karate chop their arm below the elbow or their foot/ankle, then that limb is out!
- A player is out of the game when both of their arms and both of their legs are out.
- The winner is the last ninja standing!
