1. My name is Yining, you can call me Jenny. I am currently studying creative computing in CCI as a postgraduate student. My undergraduate major was digital media design and game design, so I always try to intersect interactive design and games together to make my projects interesting and useful at the same time. I would rather say i am a programmer than an artist or designer because I dont think I am that creative. That's also the reason why I love talking to people. I really enjoy having a talk with people from different fields, people have a diversity of perspectives depending on their majors, interests, cultures, and races. I can always be inspired by that and get my project improved. I hope everyone here can also enjoy today's worshop.

2. We will discuss how design can be used as a method to pose questions and conduct research. Emphasizing that design research, especially when integrated into the design process, can lead to the emergence of unexpected questions. I will introduce the "iterative design process" as a research methodology and illustrate it with examples from my recent game projects (Legend of Hanzi). Also, I want to say that game creation is an excellent model for research through design, as it focuses on creating delightful experiences, rather than just fulfilling utilitarian needs. Games are primarily played for the pleasure they provide, and the interaction with a game is an end in itself, not just a means to an external goal.

3. This is the rough structure of today's content. Introduction OverviewCase analyze Review Discussion. We already have the intro, next I will talk more in depth about the theory of iterative design.

4. - Before we start, I want to do a berief review of my last workshop, wich talks about the main elements of games
   - The activities or actions in a game are often designed to challenge and engage the plays, requiring their involvement and interaction with the game system or other players.
   - Rules define what is allowed and what is not allowed within the game's context. Rules can cover various aspects of the game, including player behavior, movement, use of resources, scoring, and winning conditions. Boundaries provide structure and fairness to the game, ensuring that all participants understand how to play and compete.
   - Objectives give purpose and direction to the gameplay, providing a target or outcome that players aim to reach. Objectives can be diverse and depend on the type of game, providing motivation and a sense of progression as players work towards accomplishing them.
   - Players actively take part in the activities, follow the rules, pursue the objectives, and interact with other participants or the game system. They contribute to the dynamics of the game through their decisions, actions, strategies, and interactions, shaping the overall experience and outcomes.

6. Mainly of my theory is from Eric's essay, Play as a research: The Iterative design. I really recommand you look into it if you are also doing some designs or being interested with game designing.

7.
- Iterative design is a design methodology based on a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a work in progress.
- In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented.
- Test; analyze; refine. And repeat. Because the experience of viewers/users/players/etc cannot ever be completely predicted, in an iterative process design decisions are based on the experience of the prototype in progress.
- The prototype is tested, revisions are made, and the project is tested once more.
- In this way, the project develops through an ongoing dialogue between the designers, the design, and the testing audience.

8.
- In the case of games, iterative design means playtesting. Throughout the entire process of design and development, your game is played. You play it. The rest of the development team plays it. Other people in the office play it. People visiting your office play it. You organize groups of testers that match your target audience. You have as many people as possible play the game.
- In each case, you observe them, ask them questions, then adjust your design and playtest again.
- This iterative process of design is radically different than typical retail game development. More often than not, at the start of the design process for a computer or console title, a game designer will think up a finished concept and then write an exhaustive design document that outlines every possible aspect of the game in minute detail.
- Invariably, the final game never resembles the carefully conceived original. A more iterative design process, on the other hand, will not only streamline development resources, but will also result in a more powerful and successful final product.

9. I hope the theory part was not very boring. From now on I will analyze some of my projects as example. The first case is a very simple physical game called black box challenge.

10. Our game inspiration was from an old story in bible. 
  The Tower of Babel narrative in Genesis is an origin myth and parable meant to explain why the world's peoples speak different languages.
According to the story, a united human race speaking a single language and migrating eastward, comes to the land of Shinar/ˈʃaɪnə/. There they agree to build a city and a tower with its top in the sky. Then Yahweh/ja:wa:/, observing their city and tower. The God was concerned that humans had blasphemed /blæsˈfiːm/ by building the tower to avoid a second flood so God brought into existence multiple languages. As a result, humans were divided into linguistic groups, unable to understand each other.

11. Based on this story, we had our first prototype.
- This game needes four players and be separated into four parts by its rule. The first player touch the object with eyes closed or covered, guess and describe by human language but no directly say the name.
- The second player draws from the description and then shows it to the third player in silence.
- The third player guess based on the content of the picture and describes it to the fourth player in body language in slience.
- The last player guess the item in the box by body movements.

12. Designing a first prototype requires strategic thinking about how to most quickly implement a playable version that can begin to address the project’s chief uncertainties in a meaningful way. Can you create a paper version of your digital game? Can you design a short version of a game that will last much longer in its final form? Can you test the interaction pattern of a massively multiplayer game with just a handful of players?
In the iterative design process, the most detailed thinking you need at any moment is that which will get you to your next prototype. It is certainly important to understand the big picture as well: the larger conceptual, technical, and design questions that drive the project as a whole. Just be sure not to let your design get ahead of your iterative research. Keep your eye on the prize, but leave room for play in your design, for the potential to change as you learn from your playtesting, accepting the fact that some of your assumptions will undoubtedly be wrong.

13. Now lets create our own iteration. It doesnt have to be a geme. It can be your school project, your interested topic, or you can even do a brainstorm to find your topic. But no pressure this is just for helping you understand it and apply to your future work.

16. Our second generation is a physical combined video game. It still based on the tower babel story, but we focus more on the tower building. Based on the rule, four players have to work together to build a tower as tall as they can. There is a pannel on the bottom of the screen as ground, the brick would randomly appear on top of the screen. Three players need to stand separatly back to the screen to control three sensors, separatly for left right and up. The other player stand in front of screen as a conductor, giving oder to the other three players and hit the comfirm button.

17. I didnt show our original prototype bucause it was so ugly that we didnt want to keep any proof. Some of you didnt show your first prototype might also because of that. but Initial prototypes are usually quite ugly. Game prototypes do not emphasize aesthetics or narrative content: they emphasize the game rules, which manifest as the internal logic of the game, tied to the player’s interaction. Visuals, audio, and story are important aspects of a game, but the core uncertainties of game design, the questions that a prototype should address, lie in the more fundamental elements of rules and play.
Another way of framing this problem is to ask, What is the activity of the game? Rather than asking what the game is about, ask what the player is actually doing from moment to moment as they play. Virtually all games have a core mechanic, an action or set of actions that players will repeat over and over as they move through the designed system of a game. The prototype should help you understand what this core mechanic is and how the activity becomes meaningful over time. Asking questions about your game’s core mechanic can guide the creation of your first prototype, as well as successive iterations. Ideally, initial prototypes model this core mechanic and begin to test it through play.

18. Our two previous versions project were separately focus on understanding and misunderstanding, so Our third generation roots on the breaking down the language barrier. Since all of us in the group are not first language English speaker, we could tell the huge gap between languages. English and other European languages are made by letters, but Chinese characters are derived from hieroglyphs base on painting. So we want to use ancient Chinese hieroglyphics to break the language barrier, hoping that people who have not learned Chinese can also understand the origin and development of Chinese. Here we have a video as introduction.

19.Iterative design is a process-based design methodology, but it is also a form of design research. To design a game is to construct a set of rules. But the point of game design is not to have players experience rules -- it is to have players experience play. Game design is therefore a second-order design problem, in which designers craft play, but only indirectly, through the systems of rules that game designers create. Play arises out of the rules as they are inhabited and enacted by players, creating emergent patterns of behavior, sensation, social exchange, and meaning. Thus the necessity of the iterative design process. The delicate interaction of rule and play is something too subtle and too complex to script out in advance, requiring the improvisational balancing that only testing and prototyping can provide.
The principles of the iterative process are clearly applicable beyond the limited domain of games. Rules and play are just game design terms for structure and experience. Games provide particularly clear examples of iterative design, but any design field can benefit from such an approach.
In iterative design, there is a blending of designer and user, of creator and player. It is a process of design through the reinvention of play. Through iterative design, designers create systems and play with them. They become participants, but do so in order to critique their creations, to bend them, break them, and re-fashion them into something new. And in these procedures of investigation and experimentation, a special form of research takes place. The process of iteration, of design through play, is a way of discovering the answers to questions you didn’t even know were there. And that makes it a powerful and important form of design research.
