# Exploring Iterative Design: A Workshop on Design Research Methods
## Description
Join us for an engaging workshop that delves into the realm of design as a means of posing questions and pushing boundaries. In this session, we will explore how design research can transcend the confines of specific design challenges and expand into broader inquiries. By seamlessly integrating design research into the design process, novel and unexpected questions emerge organically from the act of designing itself.

Drawing from my ongoing game project, this workshop will provide an insightful walkthrough of a research-driven design approach—specifically, the iterative design process. Through real-world examples and practical demonstrations, participants will gain valuable insights into how to navigate and harness the potential of iterative design.

Whether you are a seasoned designer or just embarking on your creative journey, this workshop offers a unique opportunity to unravel the synergies between research and design. Prepare to unlock fresh perspectives and learn how to foster innovation by embracing the dynamic interplay between design and research. Join us in this thought-provoking session and elevate your design practice to new heights.
